# CVND---Image-Captioning-Project

## Project overview
_In this project we will try to perform image captioning on [Microsoft COCO data set](http://cocodataset.org/#home)_

## Pretrained Weights for model
If you do not want to train the model from scratch, you can use a pretrained model. You can download the pretrained model [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/wu5gz3sq5nz2d6p/AAA-UWz3ed51Gv9npRGG3VWha?dl=0).The encoder-3.pkl and decoder3.pkl should be present inside `models` folder .
